In JavaScript, parseInt() is a built-in function that parses a string and converts it into an integer (whole number).

    Explanation:
    parseInt starts parsing 'M7F'.
    The first character, 'M', is not numeric, so parsing cannot begin.
    When the first character is invalid, parseInt returns NaN (Not a Number).
    Result: NaN

    Explanation:
    parseInt parses the string from left to right until it encounters a character that isn't part of a valid number.

    Parsing stops when it encounters the + character, which isn't numeric.
